Welcome to my academic website!  I am Hongpeng Jin, a Ph.D. student in the Knight Foundation School of Computing and Information Sciences (KFSCIS) at Florida International University (FIU). I began my acdamic journey in Fall 2023 under the supervision of [Dr. Yanzhao Wu](https://yanzhaowu.me/). 

My primary **research interests focus** on Large Language Models (LLMs) and LLM Agents, emphasizing their efficient inference, deployment, and practical applications. Additionally, I have a strong interest in ensemble learning and optimization strategies, aiming to enhance the scalability, efficiency, and robustness of AI systems. **My goal** is to deeply explore the underlying mechanisms and untapped potential of large language models, aiming to uncover innovative findings with significant academic value and practical industrial applications.

I hold a Master of Science in Information Technology and Management from the University of Texas at Dallas. Before pursuing my Ph.D., I gained valuable **industry experience** as a Data Scientist at Cintra US, where I developed machine learning models to optimize dynamic pricing, incident detection, and analytics-driven decision-making. I also worked at HP Inc., Samsung Electronics America, and ZTE USA, gaining diverse experience across data analysis, quality assurance, and automation testing.

<span style="color: #B31B1B;">I am actively seeking **2025 Summer Research Internship opportunities** in areas related to Large Language Models (LLMs).</span>

You can also find my work experience on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hongpeng-jin/).

* **Cintra US** (Austin, TX) \| Data Scientist \| May 2022 – Aug. 2023 
  * Built machine learning models to improve the work efficiency of business and operation teams, including:  
    1. **Dynamic Pricing**: Developed LightGBM (quantile) models to predict future demand and its confidence interval, enabling the identification of demand anomalies.  
    2. **Incident Detection**: Created a prediction system using real-time vehicle status data, incident history reports, and highway pavement data.  
    3. **Analytics AI**: Built predictive models and explainability tools for business decision-making.  
  * Conducted statistical analyses (A/B tests) to quantify driver behaviors and preferences, such as peak-hour behavior and lane-changing patterns, while measuring the impact of external interventions (e.g., large events, extreme weather).

* **HP Inc.** (Vancouver, WA) \| Marketing Survey Data Analyst \| Apr. 2020 – May 2022 
  * Modeled large-scale email survey data to analyze the impact of customer journey experiences on Net Promoter Scores (NPS) and provide actionable insights.  
  * Prioritized customer review records for response team efficiency using Supervised LDA topic modeling and statistical learning models.  
  * Assisted UX teams with power analysis, A/B testing, and general linear regression methods to optimize email survey titles and UI.

* **Samsung Electronics America** (Plano, TX) \| QA Engineer \| Mar. 2019 – Mar. 2020
  * Validated functions related to communication networks of Android devices across different wireless networks (GSM, WCDMA, 4G, and 5G) through software, field, and automation testing.
  * Analyzed emerging issues based on device logs and testing data to identify root causes and closely collaborated with the R&D team to conduct further verifications and analyses.

* **ZTE USA Inc.** (Richardson, TX) \| Software Test Engineer \| Apr. 2018 – Mar. 2019 
  * Developed and implemented the "AIO" automation testing project, transitioning from manual to automated testing to enhance efficiency and quality.
